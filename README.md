# survey-form-fcc

This is a design project for completing [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)'s *Responsive Web Design Certification*. The goal is to make a survey form. I've made a simple survey form  about use of programming languages.

Here it is the model: https://survey-form.freecodecamp.rocks/

Here it is my version: https://italo617.github.io/survey-form-fcc/
